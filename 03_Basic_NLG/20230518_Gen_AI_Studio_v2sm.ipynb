      "I agree with your assessment. I think the curve will flatten somewhat, with the back end being the most overvalued part for now. I think we will consolidate sideways for a few sessions, but if the current rate of injections continues, the end users/utilities will have to stop buying due to real physical limitations to take the gas into storage. The funds are short, but only 6% of open interest and have covered in the latter part of last week. I think volatility will come in again too. I think it will sell off to $4.50 and then scale up. I have talked to some others who think it can't go below $4.00, so I actually think the surprise in the short term will be a break of $4.00. Who knows, it could work the other way. I agree that I am disappointed in the lack of producer selling. We had one deal come through Thursday, but it had been worked on for months, so it was not price relevant.

      "In a professional setting, it's important to be clear and concise in your communication. When you ask \"What does that mean,\" it can come across as being vague or even accusatory.

I believe that we are allowed to enter into new agreements, without court approval, provided that they are in the ordinary course. However, my understanding is that the process for assuming an existing contract is typically more time-consuming, as it requires some oversight/approval by the bankruptcy court/creditors committee. It may also require the debtor to rectify any prior defaults. Therefore, I think it would be faster to enter into a new agreement, rather than assuming an existing contract.\n",

If the energy was needed by CORE, then the deals would simply be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply. However, since the energy is not needed, the state could sell back the excess and then compute the exact loss. The state could then put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers to recoup that amount over time. This would be similar to a CTC type recovery period, but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.\n",

      "- We are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online, one with the collateral clause and one without. The assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept. based on creditworthiness of the customer. Of course, this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers. We just can't carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline.\n",

      "- Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the \"Exempt Futures Market Declaration\"? Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers? Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power (if any)?\n",

      "2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates.\n",

      "1. I agree that we could theoretically agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote. However, this is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex. It is my understanding that it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal. I agree that this does not really help ICE's volumes or liquidity. Funds want liquidity, so they will not flock to ICE in its current state.\n",

In terms of who would want baseload gas for December in that scenario, I think AGAs would be a good candidate. I also think that a high 70s print on the EIA report would be neutral for the market, and if it comes in between 70 and 85, that would be good for volatility.\n",

      "I returned a call to Ira Polk and Kevin Davis today at Man. Ira was not in so I spoke with Kevin. Kevin asked me if Enron would consider posting more margin than required by NYMEX on our option positions. He said that \"given ENE is now flush with liquidity\" he thinks it would make Enron \"look good\" in front of the EDF Board. He asked for twice the margin required by NYMEX but stated that he would be \"ecstatic\" with 1.5x (about $5 million.) He specifically asked me not to elevate this request to your level but I feel you have a right to know what EDF is asking of ENE. He also told me that if we did not post the additional margin then EDF would have to give us intraday calls every time the market moved against our positions. Kevin also state that EDF is too small compared to a bank and that he would prefer if EDF odes only execution of ENE deals and we clear all ENE transactions through a bank.\n",
