       "0  How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks. Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key----to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty funny.

She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks. Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key----to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty funny.

       "0  How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks. Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key----to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.     \n",

I am also going to contact Rich Kinder this week to talk about the possibilities. I very much appreciate your input and your insight and would welcome your help when the time is right. As a side note you may have heard that Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one priority. As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant. (Dave's call obviously). Thanks again</td>\n",

These plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development. Their only operational plants are in Colorado. They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines. If you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines.

       "129   I have a meeting with Dave on Monday at 8:30am. We will be bringing the deal guys (Bill Grealis, Chuck Winger, Art Vivar, myself and possibly one other) so we're ready to listen and make something shake loose. I am also going to contact Rich Kinder this week to talk about the possibilities. I very much appreciate your input and your insight and would welcome your help when the time is right. As a side note you may have heard that Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one priority. As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant. (Dave's call obviously). Thanks again     \n",
       "130                          Mike: Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan. These guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput. These plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development. Their only operational plants are in Colorado. They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines. If you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines. Hope this helps. Ben   \n",

       "129   Mike: Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan. These guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput. These plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development. Their only operational plants are in Colorado. They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines. If you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines. Hope this helps. Ben  \n",
