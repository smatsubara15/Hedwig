I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin.

       "1  Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time.   "

To do &gt; so I need a corresponding term gas price for same. Microturbine is an &gt; onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity &gt; on customer site (degen). using natural gas. In doing so, I need your &gt; best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for &gt; annual/seasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for &gt; customer. We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh 's using &gt; microturbine or sell them turbines themselves. kWh deal must have limited/ &gt; no risk forward gas price to make deal work. Therein comes Sempra energy &gt; gas trading, truly you. &gt; &gt; We are proposing installing 180 - 240 units across a large number of &gt; stores (60-100) in San Diego. &gt; Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent. &gt; &gt; For 6-8 hours a day Microturbine run time: &gt; Gas requirement for 180 microturbines 227 - 302 MMcf per year &gt; Gas requirement for 240 microturbines 302 - 403 MMcf per year &gt; &gt; Gas will likely be consumed from May through September, during peak &gt; electric period. &gt; Gas price required: Burnertip price behind (LDC) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric &gt; Need detail breakout of commodity and transport cost (firm or &gt; interruptible). &gt; &gt; Should you have additional questions, give me a call. &gt; Let me assure you, this is real deal!! &gt; &gt; Buck Buckner, P.E., MBA &gt; Manager, Business Development and Planning &gt; Big Box Retail Sales &gt; Honeywell Power Systems, Inc. &gt; 8725 Pan American Frwy &gt; Albuquerque, NM 87113 &gt; 505-798-6424 &gt; 505-798-6050x &gt; 505-220-4129 &gt; 888/501-3145 &gt;</td>\n",

Either Cable Modem or DSL service. When most of these lines where installed, we did not have a standard on how to connect back to the Enron network. Most if not all of you are using the Client software on your PC's. In order to provide more security to both Enron and Your PC. We need to configure and deploy a Nortel Instant Internet Box. the way the Nortel box works is what they call splitt tunnelling. If it sees traffic that needs to go to enron it will go through the tunnel, other wise it goes directly to the internet. We will need to know the following information to configure and deploy the Router 1. UserName and Login if required by the ISP. 2. If you have static IP addresses, We need to know that as well. 3. Co/RC to charge for the Nortel Box (Approx $500.00) If you no longer have DSL or Cable service or You do not have either please let us know. Other wise Please return the above information back to Enron network security. Thanks Mark Scott</td>\n",

Either Cable Modem or DSL service. When most of these lines where installed, we did not have a standard on how to connect back to the Enron network. Most if not all of you are using the Client software on your PC's. In order to provide more security to both Enron and Your PC. We need to configure and deploy a Nortel Instant Internet Box. the way the Nortel box works is what they call splitt tunnelling. If it sees traffic that needs to go to enron it will go through the tunnel, other wise it goes directly to the internet. We will need to know the following information to configure and deploy the Router 1. UserName and Login if required by the ISP. 2. If you have static IP addresses, We need to know that as well. 3. Co/RC to charge for the Nortel Box (Approx $500.00) If you no longer have DSL or Cable service or You do not have either please let us know. Other wise Please return the above information back to Enron network security. Thanks Mark Scott    \n",
