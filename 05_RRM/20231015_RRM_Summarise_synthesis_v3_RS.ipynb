There were a number of errors in the list as it pertained to Canada. Of particular note is the inclusion in the list of a number of agreements with either Enron Oil Canada Ltd. (which was part of what is now EOG) or EOTT Canada. As far as I am aware, Enron Corp. is no longer in any way affiliated or associated with either EOG or EOTT, having divested itself of any interest in either, and Enron Canada certainly has no knowledge of, involvement with or records pertaining to any of those agreements. I do not believe that they should be included in any master netting agreement between BP and Enron. In addition, it appears that they have listed the master physical gas agreement with ECC twice (I have deleted the first reference, being document number one) and they did not include the IT physical gas agreement with ECC, which I have added.
