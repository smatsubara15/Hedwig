       "0   How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks. Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.     \n",

The problem with our analysis yesterday was that we were not capturing the value of the incremental volumes at current curves. In effect, we have new volumes which need to be valued against the current curves for the first time. Yesterday, we were valuing the new volumes at prior day curves. This is WRONG.
