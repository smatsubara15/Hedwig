What time does the game begin?\\n\\nThanks,\\nRadhika', 'Hello Scott,\\n\\nI should be free to go at 9pm that night.

Could you give me some more details about the same?\\n\\nThanks,\\nRadhika', 'Hello Kshitij,\\n\\nThat would be great, yes! I would love to attend a conference like that one. Here are my thoughts on this topic:\\n\\n- I have really high hopes from data science in the field of healthcare, especially after the newest innovation in the field around health GPT for patients. \\n- I am still worried about data security and compliances in the fieldto do with HIPAA\\n- I am curious to learn more from the experts\\n\\nIt would be great if you could send across the link.\\n\\nThanks,\\nRadhika', 'Hey Kshitij,\\n\\nSure, I would love to join the discussion!\\n\\nPlease feel free to add me to any email thread/ create a group chat with him.\\n\\nAre you also planning to talk to companies from the health data field who might be present at the conference?

The gist of it was that he thinks our product is already good, but we can use some minor tweaks to make it even better, I am mentioning these suggecstions by him below:\\n\\n1. Including conversation threads in the prompt for better context \\n2. Use rating through either LLM/ reinforcement human scores\\n3. Capture relationship between the replier and sender from their past email interactions \\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Happy to hop on a call to discuss these too.\\n\\nRegards,\\nRadhika\", 'Hello Kshitij,\\n\\nI should be free anytime this Wednesday and Thursday, post noon.
