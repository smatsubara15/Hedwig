Scott,Radhika,I like baseball too. Can you do sports betting on badminton?,"Hey Scott,

I don't think so - badminton is a far dignifies sport for sports betting. But I can check and let you know. What's been up today?

Best,
Radhika","Hi there,

Glad to hear that you also enjoy baseball! As for your question about sports betting on badminton, the answer is yes, you can definitely place bets on badminton matches. In fact, badminton is a popular sport for betting in many countries, particularly in Asia where it is a widely played and highly competitive sport.

If you're interested in trying your hand at badminton betting, I recommend doing some research on the players and their recent performances, as well as the odds and betting options available. As with any form of betting, it's important to gamble responsibly and within your means.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hope you are doing well!

Here are the minutes of meeting from yesterday's call with Nick. The gist of it was that he thinks our product is already good, but we can use some minor tweaks to make it even better, I am mentioning these suggecstions by him below:

1. Including conversation threads in the prompt for better context 
2. Use rating through either LLM/ reinforcement human scores
3. Capture relationship between the replier and sender from their past email interactions 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Happy to hop on a call to discuss these too.

Thanks for sending over the minutes from yesterday's call with Nick. I'm glad to hear that he thinks our product is already good, but I agree that there's always room for improvement. 

I appreciate the suggestions he made, and I think they could definitely help enhance our product. I don't have any immediate questions, but I'll take some time to review the suggestions and think about how we can implement them. 

If I do have any questions or if I want to discuss these suggestions further, I'll definitely reach out to you to schedule a call. 

Thanks again for sharing this with me!

Kshitij,Scott,"Scott, given that it is a long 8 hour drive and we have 4 people already in the car, do you think we can fit an additional friend?
It can help us reduce the per person costs, and I can cover for you as well for some time.

What do you think?
Best,
Kshitij",Im sure people will be fine. Im down to do that if itll help reduce the costs lol.,"Hi Kshitij,

Thanks for reaching out. While I appreciate the offer to cover for me, I don't think it's a good idea to add another person to the car. With four people already in the car, it might be a tight squeeze and could make the long 8 hour drive uncomfortable for everyone. Additionally, adding another person could also affect the amount of luggage space we have.

I understand that reducing costs is important, but I think it's better to prioritize everyone's comfort and safety during the drive. Perhaps we can explore other cost-saving options, such as splitting gas and toll expenses evenly among the four of us.

Thanks for understanding.

As long as Aarushi is in our car, I don't really care who else is there.

Regarding your question about Aarushi helping on our project, I think it's a great idea. She's your friend and if she can help us out, that would be awesome.

Radhika","Hey Radhika, Thank you so much for these meeting points. We are lucky to have Nick's and Ignas' expertise for our project. I would love to discuss them further over a call.

What time would work the best for you?","Hey Radhika,

Thanks for sending over the minutes from yesterday's call with Nick. I appreciate the suggestions he made to improve our product. I think they are all great ideas and I'm excited to discuss them further with you.

I'm available to hop on a call to discuss these suggestions whenever works best for you. How about we schedule a call for Thursday at 4 pm? Let me know if that works for you.

Also, I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation about the DSI Conference. Were you able to register for it? I think it would be a great opportunity for us to learn more about LLM applications in the healthcare industry.

Looking forward to catching up with you soon.

Best,

Kshitij,Scott,"Scott, given that it is a long 8 hour drive and we have 4 people already in the car, do you think we can fit an additional friend?
It can help us reduce the per person costs, and I can cover for you as well for some time.

What do you think?
Best,
Kshitij",Im sure people will be fine. Im down to do that if itll help reduce the costs lol.,"Hey Kshitij,

I think it's definitely doable to fit an additional friend in the car. As long as we can make sure everyone is comfortable and has enough space, it shouldn't be a problem. Plus, having another person can definitely help reduce the per person costs, so that's a good idea.

As for who the additional friend is, I don't really have a preference as long as they're cool and won't cause any issues during the trip. And yeah, Aarushi can definitely come with us, that's not a problem.

Thanks for offering to cover for me as well, I appreciate it. Let's plan on leaving at noon on Friday and we can figure out the details of who's riding with us and any other logistics before then.

Looking forward to the trip and getting some dinner at that delish place you mentioned!

Best,

Kshitij,Radhika,"Hey Radhika, were you able to register for the DSI Conference? Best, Kshitij","Hello Kshitij,

Thanks for your email! Hope you are having a good week.

I am not sure of the DSI Conference you are referring to? Could you give me some more details about the same?

Thanks,
Radhika","Hey Kshitij,

Thanks for checking in! Yes, I was able to register for the DSI Conference. Thank you for sending me the link. I'm really excited to attend and learn from the experts.

By the way, I was wondering if you have any plans to talk to companies from the health data field who might be present at the conference? I think it would be a great opportunity to connect with them and learn more about their work. Prof Bose might be able to connect you to some of his contacts there, so it's definitely worth considering. I might reach out to him separately regarding this too.

Also, I wanted to follow up on the suggestions that Nick had for our GPT model. Do you think they make sense as additions? Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to hop on a call to discuss further.

Thanks again for reaching out!

Regards,
