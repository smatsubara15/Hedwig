I appreciate the invite a lot. But I don't enjoy bball. Can we go watch orchestra/ a broadway show instead?

Radhika"
Basketball Game,Scott,Bro itll be fun trust me. I wanna watch sports. Broadway is super boring. Ill buy u a hot dog if u come with me.,Radhika,"Hey Scott,

Thanks,
Radhika"
Basketball Game,Scott,ah but meat is so delish. no worries though. The game starts at 9 pm. U got other plans for that night?,Radhika,"Hello Scott,

Radhika"
Basketball Game,Scott,"Ill teach u about basketball dont worry, ill get u a beer if you dont want a hot dog. Do you like any sports?",Radhika,"Scott,

That sounds great! You do owe me a drink for all the nice things I do for you as your friend. I do like badminton and cricket. What are the other sports you like?

Radhika"
Basketball Game,Scott,I like baseball too. Can you do sports betting on badminton?,Radhika,"Hey Scott,

I don't think so - badminton is a far dignifies sport for sports betting. But I can check and let you know. What's been up today?

Best,
Radhika"
Basketball Game,Scott,"Bro, badminton is boring, what are you talking about. Anyways, Im really tired. I been writing a bunch of emails. What about u?",Radhika,"Hey Scott,

New Member Onboarding,Scott,She does Applied Math. Dunno what she does but im just tryna to get to know her better tbh. U want her email?,Kshitij,"Hey Scott, Applied Mathematics is a great skillset! We can definitely benefit from her in case she's willing. What does her availability look like?
Best, Kshitij"
New Member Onboarding,Scott,Let me hit her up and ask her. Can I be the one that does the study with her. Shes cool and i wanna show her that im smarrt,Kshitij,"I know you two are fairly close Scott. I met her and her boyfriend last week, and both of them are such nice people. 
Conceptually she's very strong, and it should be an amazing learning opportunity for both you two.

Do you know what part of our project she would be most interested to take up?"
New Member Onboarding,Scott,":( Oh, didnt know she had a boyfriend. All good tho, she said can help with ranking our responses. She said she avaiable on Friday at noon. U cool with that?",Kshitij,"Absolutely, that would be great!
I also had a few conceptual mathematical doubts around Rouge scores. Maybe I can use her help on that?

Best,
Kshitij"
New Member Onboarding,Scott,She said she doesnt wanna use her brain that much lol. She be stressed out with her work. I think thats an excuse cuz she doesnt actually know what a Rouge score is.,Kshitij,"Haha Scott, 
You have a great sense of humour.

Considering how intense her program is, along with all the PHd applications. I am sure she would enjoy this slightly non-technical work.

Lets bring her aboard for sure :)
Best, Kshitij"
New Member Onboarding,Scott,Okay u can ask her when she gets here. So does Friday at noon work then?,Kshitij,"That is indeed perfect yes!
Let's meet at the John Crerar Building, I have a conference room booked there between 12-4

New Member Onboarding,Scott,Alright she is down for that. She said she hopes it doesnt take that long lol. U wanna get dinner together afterwards?,Kshitij,"Absolutely!
I have been thinking of checking out Velvet Taco in West Loop. Maybe we can drive down there post work? What bettter way of relaxing on a Friday

Best,
Kshitij"
New Member Onboarding,Scott,I heard that place is delish. Lets go and then maybe we can check out some turtle racing at Tin Lizzie.,Kshitij,"Turtle Racing?

Kshitij"
New Member Onboarding,Scott,"This sounds like a fun plan bro. Just to confirm, Aarushi can come right?",Kshitij,"Hey Scott, yes absolutely we can bring her!"
Updates on Capstone meeting with Nick,Radhika,"Hey Kshitij,

Hope you are doing well!

Here are the minutes of meeting from yesterday's call with Nick. The gist of it was that he thinks our product is already good, but we can use some minor tweaks to make it even better, I am mentioning these suggecstions by him below:

1. Including conversation threads in the prompt for better context 
2. Use rating through either LLM/ reinforcement human scores
3. Capture relationship between the replier and sender from their past email interactions 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Happy to hop on a call to discuss these too.

Regards,
Radhika",Kshitij,"Hey Radhika, Thank you so much for these meeting points. We are lucky to have Nick's and Ignas' expertise for our project. I would love to discuss them further over a call.

What time would work the best for you?"
Updates on Capstone meeting with Nick,Radhika,"Hello Kshitij,

I should be free anytime this Wednesday and Thursday, post noon. In the meantime, feel free to send me any questions over email/ text. Do you think the points make sense as additions to our current GPT model?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Radhika",Kshitij,"Hey Radhika, 
I have office on Wednesdays, so would Thursday work? Maybe Thursday 4 pm?
What do you think?

Best,
Kshitij"
Updates on Capstone meeting with Nick,Radhika,"Hey Kshitij,

UChicago admin budget cuts,Radhika,"Hey Kshitij,

Hope you are having a good week!

What are your thoughts on the current budget cuts that UChicago is going through at the moment? They seem to be really intense. Are your workflows affected by it in any manner?

Looking forward to your reponse!

Thanks,
Radhika",Kshitij,"Hey Radhika,

This is definitely concerning for my project. I have a meeting with the Dean this week, lets see how it goes"""
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"Hey Scott, What are the dates for the Michigan Trip?",Scott,"Yoooo, Im pretty sure its November 18-20. Its gonna be sick. Which part are you most excited for?"
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"That's amazing Scott! I am extremely excited about the Mackinaw Island. What about you?
Best, Kshitij",Scott,"Bro I havnt heard of that one, but I dunno much about what there is there. im just trynna have a good time. Do we have to leave so early tho?"
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"I can understand the issue Scott. It's just that we have an 8 hour drive in front of us, and I think we should make an early start.
What time would be the most convenient for you?
Best, Kshitij",Scott,"I wanna sleeeeep. im so tired already and i wake up at noon. But is all good bro, ill try my best. hopefully we dont crash lmao. U gonna be okay driving?"
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"Completely understand Scott. Lets do this, I can do heavylifting on the driving durin 18 morning hours, and you can rest at that time. After some time we can switch seats.
I am anyways an early riser, so this should not be an issue at all for me.

What do you think?
Best, Kshitij",Scott,"For sure bro, we can do that. Do we know who is gonna be in our car yet? If Radhika isnt gonna be then we need to figure that out. I dont really care who else is as long as Aarushi is in our car? Do u think we need anything else for the trip?"
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"Yeah I think everyone from Hyde Park will be in our car. That would include both Radhika and Aarushi. Can we make a stop at Green Bay on our way?
There is a really cool museum I would love to check out.
Best,
Kshitij",Scott,"Im down to stop in Green Bay, those nerds have a class they have to attend so we can have fun while they do that. Is the museum free? I aint got money lol"
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"Perfect, I am a huge fan of the packers. And would love to check out their stadium.
What is our accomodation situation like? Do we have a hotel or an airbnb?

Best,
Kshitij",Scott,"Down to check out a football game while we are there, but its expensive lol. Our airbnb is super sick. Its got a hot tub, sauna, game room, and fire pit. i wanna hike, but I dont think people will wanna leave the house."
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"In case we have a big stop, we can definitely check-out the game! 

A sauna and hot-tub in mid-November sounds amazing. I can't wait to check out the trails nearby, I have heard Upper Peninsula is in a league of its own.

Best, 
Kshitij",Scott,I just hope that we see the northern lights. that would be so sick.. I also hope it wont be too cold. I gotta keep track of the weather bc if its snowing while we drive I need to buy tire chains.
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"Well absolutely, safety always comes first.
We can head down to Home Depot this weekend, in case you need any additional hands.

Best,
Kshitij",Scott,"Okay yeah, lets do that. Im kinda down to risk it since I like living life on the edge and I dont have any money."
Michigan Trip,Kshitij,"Scott, given that it is a long 8 hour drive and we have 4 people already in the car, do you think we can fit an additional friend?
It can help us reduce the per person costs, and I can cover for you as well for some time.

What do you think?
Best,
Kshitij",Scott,Im sure people will be fine. Im down to do that if itll help reduce the costs lol.
UChicago Conference,Kshitij,"Hey Radhika, were you able to register for the DSI Conference? Best, Kshitij",Radhika,"Hello Kshitij,

Thanks for your email! Hope you are having a good week.

I am not sure of the DSI Conference you are referring to? Could you give me some more details about the same?

Thanks,
Radhika"
UChicago Conference,Kshitij,"Hey Radhika, the advisory committee had shared this conference happening in Northwestern around LLM applications in healthcare industry.
It happens in early November. I can share the link if you want.

Best,
Kshitij",Radhika,"Hello Kshitij,

That would be great, yes! I would love to attend a conference like that one. Here are my thoughts on this topic:

- I have really high hopes from data science in the field of healthcare, especially after the newest innovation in the field around health GPT for patients. 
- I am still worried about data security and compliances in the fieldto do with HIPAA
- I am curious to learn more from the experts

It would be great if you could send across the link.

Thanks,
Radhika"
UChicago Conference,Kshitij,"Hey Radhika,

Yes absolutely! I have forwarded you the meeting invite. I am more interested around HIPAA compliance concerns in this field.
I am planning to meet Prof Bose to discuss this further. He has done some tremendous work in this field.

In case you're available, would love for you to join.
Best,
Kshitij",Radhika,"Hey Kshitij,

Sure, I would love to join the discussion!

Please feel free to add me to any email thread/ create a group chat with him.

Are you also planning to talk to companies from the health data field who might be present at the conference? I think you should really try to do that given Prof Bose might be able to connect you to some of his contacts there! 

I might reach out to him separately regarding this too.

Regards,
Radhika"
