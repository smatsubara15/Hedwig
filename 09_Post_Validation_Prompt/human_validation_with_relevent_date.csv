Hope you are doing well!

Here are the minutes of meeting from yesterday's call with Nick. The gist of it was that he thinks our product is already good, but we can use some minor tweaks to make it even better, I am mentioning these suggecstions by him below:

1. Including conversation threads in the prompt for better context 
2. Use rating through either LLM/ reinforcement human scores
3. Capture relationship between the replier and sender from their past email interactions 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Happy to hop on a call to discuss these too.

Are you also planning to talk to companies from the health data field who might be present at the conference? I think you should really try to do that given Prof Bose might be able to connect you to some of his contacts there!
