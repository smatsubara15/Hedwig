She was 2 days away from leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at the school schedule for the first time in several weeks. Now mind you she had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a key to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.     \n",

      "Thanks for your email. I don't think the email you forwarded me constitutes a change in Edison's position regarding payment timelines. From the relevant emails we've been exchanging, it seems that there are a lot of uncertainties and variables at play, and it's difficult to predict when payments will be made. As one email mentioned, until the investment banks and commercial banks assess whether there is sufficient exit financing to take out the \"just pay me nows,\" the situation will likely drag out. \n",

      "Thank you for your email. I believe the confusion may stem from the recent changes with PGE. As you may know, there have been some issues with their accounting practices and their ability to pay suppliers. PG&E is currently fighting the TURN accounting, which has wiped out hopes of collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting perspective. The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.\n",

One of my colleagues mentioned that until the investment banks / commercial banks get in and assess whether there is an exit financing that is sufficient to take out the \"just pay me nows\" they are nowhere. This will drag out. The capital markets could not be more choppy to launch this discussions than right now.\n",
